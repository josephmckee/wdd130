    <h2>Joseph McKee</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Joseph McKee. I'm currently a software engineering major but ultimately want to become an instructional designer!
    I love music, I've been playing percussion and piano for a long time and still do. I also love to play video games, especially with friends!
    My favorite game right now is probably Sea of Thieves.</p>
    <p>I'm from Rexburg, Idaho, but I've also lived in California, Nebraska, and North Dakota. I have three siblings and my parents are both educators.
    I'm super excited to take this class on web design because I have already been loving coding for a few years now and am stoked to have a new way to apply it.</p>
